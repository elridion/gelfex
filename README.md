# Gelfx
Elixir logger backend for Graylog based on GELF.
Documentation is available on [hex.pm](https://hexdocs.pm/gelfx)

## Installation
The package can be installed by adding `gelfx` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:gelfx, "~> 1.0"}
  ]
end
```
And adding it to your `:logger` configuration in `config.exs`:
```elixir
config :logger,
  backends: [
    :console,
    Gelfx
  ]
```
Since GELF relies on json to encode the payload Gelfx will need a JSON library. By default Gelfx will use Jason which needs to be added to your deps in mix.exs:
```elixir
    {:jason, "~> 1.0"}
``` 
## Features
Gelfx has full support of the Elixir Logger and Gelf/Graylog features.

- Support for __TCP__, __UDP__, and __HTTP__
- Graceful changes to the protocol configuration during runtime
- Support for __GZIP__ and __ZLIB__ compression
- __(TCP)__ When Gelfx is unable to transmit packets due to an connection loss packets are stored and resend once the connection is reestablished
- Log-levels are correctly mapped onto the corresponding GELF selectors
- Elixir `format` - Log messages are formatted using the [`Elixir.Logger.Formatter`](https://hexdocs.pm/logger/Logger.Formatter.html)
- Logger`metadata` is correctly the GELF payload
- Support for the `utc_log` Logger option, since GELF expects utc timestamps this has to be handled accordingly
